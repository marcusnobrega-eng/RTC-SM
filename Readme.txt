Welcome to RTC-Stormwater_V12

If you have any questions, please contact me at:

marcusnobrega.engcivil@gmail.com.

You will need the topotoolbox tool, which can be downloaded at:

https://topotoolbox.wordpress.com/download/

You will also need rasters of the digital elevation model, land use and land cover, and soil texture, all of which are in the same resolution and extent.

All input data is entered in an Excel file attached to this zipped file.

You must enter the rasters' directories and the top toolbox inside the Excel file.

Do not change the names of the books on the Excel sheet.

For mathematical reference, please refer to:
